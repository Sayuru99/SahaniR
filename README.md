## Introduction

**SahaniR** is a next-generation backend framework built in Rust, designed to empower developers in creating secure, scalable, and performant applications. Drawing inspiration from cosmological principles—such as pocket universes from inflationary theory and spacetime from general relativity—SahaniR reimagines backend architecture as a dynamic, interconnected cosmos. It combines the modular elegance of NestJS with the robust, type-safe ecosystem of Rust.

"R" for Rust, SahaniR embodies enduring strength and efficiency. Our vision: To create a framework that is not just a tool, but a paradigm shift.

## Documentation

## Workspace Structure

This repository contains the core components of the SahaniR framework in a single Cargo workspace:

-   `sahanir/`: The core framework library.
-   `sahanir-cli/`: The command-line interface for SahaniR.
-   `sahanir-macros/`: A crate containing the procedural macros for the framework.
